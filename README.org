Implementation of Knuth's MMIX computer in Common Lisp.

The goal of this project is to learn how MIX works. I know it is quite
obsolete, but I find MMIX too heavy to start with.

What is nice: With Common Lisp comes the power to spawn MIX everywhere
without having much of rewrites. On the JVM (ABCL or port it to
Clojure), as executable on Linux, Windows, UNIX (Mac) and even on
embedded devices, with ECL and uLisp!

Yes, there is a GNU package for the simulator and all, but in C, really?!

The documentation will be the program itself, if not it would be paradox
cause Knuth is the intellectual father of literate programming.

The PDF can easily be generated using [[https://pandoc.org][pandoc]],
a universal type safe markup converter. Or ask me, I'll keep the PDF
updated and hosted via git-annex.
