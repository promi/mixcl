# mixcl
Implementation of Knuth's MMIX computer in Common Lisp. 

The goal of this project is to learn how MIX works.
I know it is quite obsolete, but I find MMIX too heavy to start with.

What is nice: With Common Lisp comes the power to spawn MIX everywhere
without having much of rewrites.
On the JVM (ABCL or port it to Clojure), as executable on Linux, Windows, UNIX (Mac) and
even on embedded devices, with ECL and uLisp!

Yes, there is a GNU package for the simulator and all, but in C, really?!
